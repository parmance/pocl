Portable Computing Language (pocl) v1.3 released
-------------------------------------------------

Pocl is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the OpenCL
standard (1.2 with some 2.0 features supported). In addition to producing an
easily portable open-source OpenCL implementation, another major goal of this
project is improving performance portability of OpenCL programs with the
kernel compiler and the task runtime, reducing the need for target-dependent
manual optimizations.

Notes
-----

* Support code for older than two latest LLVM versions will be removed
  in the beginning of the next release cycle to clean up the code base.
  If you care need support for older LLVM versions in the future pocl
  releases and wish to maintain it (run a buildbot and fix issues), let
  us know!

Please note that there's an official pocl "maintenance policy" in place.
This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite project
that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future pocl releases:

Most of the code that landed to the pocl code base during this release
cycle was produced for the needs of research funded by various sources.
The Customized Parallel Computing research group of Tampere University of
Technology (Finland) likes to thank the Academy of Finland (funding
decision 297548), Business Finland (FiDiPro project StreamPro,
